-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🏦 1. Industry Background

The Indian credit card market has seen exponential growth with increasing financial inclusion, digital payments, and e-commerce adoption.
Yet, the same growth has brought a sharp rise in credit risk, defaults, and non-performing assets (NPAs).

Most banks still rely on static credit models—primarily income, CIBIL score, and city tier—to decide credit limits.
These models ignore how customers actually behave after getting the card. As a result:

- Low-risk, disciplined users are often ignored or rewarded late.

- High-risk, revolving users receive excessive limits and default under financial stress.

- Portfolio management becomes reactive instead of predictive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🎯 2. Problem Statement & Industry Gap

The current industry process lacks a real-time, data-driven framework that connects customer behavior to credit risk.

Key Gaps Identified:

1. Static segmentation → No tracking of evolving customer behavior.

2. Delayed monitoring → Banks act after delinquency, not before.

3. Lack of behavioral indicators → Credit usage patterns, repayment habits, and cash advances are rarely quantified.

4. Absence of scenario forecasting → No stress testing for economic shocks.

5. Missing prescriptive actions → No automated link between analytics and business policy.

*This project bridges that gap with a behavioral, predictive, and prescriptive analytics solution.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💡 3. Business Objective

To design a data-driven framework that:

- Segments customers by their credit behavior rather than static demographics.

- Simulates stress scenarios to anticipate default risks.

- Recommends dynamic credit and interest policies to improve profitability while reducing NPA exposure.

Instead of applying the same rule to everyone, the model recommends specific actions per customer type:

| Segment            | Business Reason                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Safe High Spenders | Reward responsible and profitable users         |
| Moderate Users     | Neutral users; low risk, stable pattern         |
| Revolvers          | Heavy credit use and partial repayments         |
| Over-Leveraged     | Financially stressed customers; prevent default |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔍 4. Project Approach

The entire project follows a three-phase analytical approach — moving from understanding customer behavior to predicting future risk and finally recommending data-driven business actions.
This approach ensures that insights are not just descriptive numbers but can be directly converted into real business strategies.

🧩 **Phase 1: Descriptive Analysis — Understanding Customer Behavior**

Objective:
To analyze and understand how customers actually use their credit cards, beyond demographic data like income or city.

Methodology:

- Collected and merged two key datasets — one containing transactional data (balances, limits, purchases, payments) and another containing demographic information (income, region, occupation).

- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering to create meaningful financial indicators such as:

  - Utilization Ratio = Balance ÷ Credit Limit (shows dependency on credit)

  - Repayment Discipline = Full or partial payment behavior

  - Cash Advance Dependency = Cash Advances ÷ Purchases (indicates liquidity stress)

- Using these features, we segmented customers into groups like Safe High Spenders, Moderate Users, Revolvers, and Over-Leveraged.

👉 *This phase answers the question: “What kinds of customers exist, and how are they behaving financially?”*

📈 **Phase 2: Predictive Analysis — Forecasting Behavior Under Stress**

Objective:
To test how these different customer segments would behave during financial stress or economic uncertainty.

Methodology:

- Simulated an economic stress test to see how risk levels change when:

  - Interest rates increase by +200 basis points (borrowing becomes costlier).

  - Repayment ability drops by 15% (reflecting job loss or financial pressure).

- Calculated new utilization and repayment ratios under these stressed conditions.

- Derived a risk score combining both usage and repayment behavior to identify which segments are most likely to default under stress.

👉 *This phase answers the question: “Who will remain stable, and who will face repayment difficulties if the economy worsens?”*

⚙️ **Phase 3: Prescriptive Analysis — Recommending Business Actions**

Objective:
To transform insights into practical actions that can be applied by credit risk teams or banking systems.

Methodology:

- Designed a policy rules engine that recommends operational decisions based on each customer’s segment and risk level.

- Example:

   - Safe High Spenders → Increase credit limit, reduce APR (reward good behavior).

   - Revolvers → Cap limit or increase APR (prevent overexposure).
  
   - Over-Leveraged → Financial counseling or assistance (reduce loss risk).

- These recommendations are explainable, data-driven, and easy to automate using SQL or BI dashboards.

👉 *This phase answers the question: “What should the bank do next to maximize growth and minimize loss?”*

🧠 **Why This Approach Matters:**

1. Descriptive analytics helps the bank see what is happening.

2. Predictive analytics helps the bank anticipate what might happen.

3. Prescriptive analytics helps the bank act before risks turn into losses.

This structured flow from understanding to forecasting to action ensures that the solution is business-relevant, measurable, and implementable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧱 5. Data Foundation

📊 **Datasets Used**

To understand customer behavior holistically, we integrated two complementary datasets:

- cc_general.xlsx → Captures transaction-level data such as balance, credit limit, total purchases, cash advances, and payment history. (This reflects how a customer uses their credit card.)

- credit_card_demographics.xlsx → Contains profile-level details such as age, income band, and geography. (This provides context about who the customer is.)

By combining these two sources, the analysis links behavioral variables (spending, repayment, credit use) with demographic patterns, forming a complete view of risk and opportunity.

🔗 **Key Integration Step**

A SQL join was performed on CUST_ID to merge both datasets and calculate critical financial indicators in one view:

          -- Create a clean, analytics-ready view with safe ratios
            CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW gold_features_v AS
            SELECT
              b.CUST_ID,
              b.AGE,
              b.INCOME_BAND,
              b.GEO_BUCKET,
              
              -- Raw financials (cast to DOUBLE for consistent math)
              CAST(a.BALANCE           AS DOUBLE) AS BALANCE,
              CAST(a.CREDIT_LIMIT      AS DOUBLE) AS CREDIT_LIMIT,
              CAST(a.PURCHASES         AS DOUBLE) AS PURCHASES,
              CAST(a.CASH_ADVANCE      AS DOUBLE) AS CASH_ADVANCE,
              CAST(a.PAYMENTS          AS DOUBLE) AS PAYMENTS,
              CAST(a.MINIMUM_PAYMENTS  AS DOUBLE) AS MINIMUM_PAYMENTS,
             
              -- Behavioral indicators (safe against NULL / divide-by-zero)
              ROUND( COALESCE(a.BALANCE,0.0)      / NULLIF(a.CREDIT_LIMIT,0.0) , 4) AS UTILIZATION_RATIO,
              ROUND( COALESCE(a.CASH_ADVANCE,0.0) / NULLIF(a.PURCHASES,0.0)    , 4) AS CASH_ADVANCE_DEP,
              
              ROUND(
                CASE
                  WHEN a.PAYMENTS IS NULL OR a.PAYMENTS = 0 THEN 0.0
                  WHEN a.MINIMUM_PAYMENTS IS NULL THEN COALESCE(a.PAYMENTS,0.0) / NULLIF(a.CREDIT_LIMIT,0.0)
                  ELSE ( COALESCE(a.PAYMENTS,0.0) - COALESCE(a.MINIMUM_PAYMENTS,0.0) ) / NULLIF(a.PAYMENTS,0.0)
                END
             , 4) AS REPAYMENT_DISCIPLINE
          
            FROM cc_general a
            JOIN credit_card_demographics b
              ON a.CUST_ID = b.CUST_ID;


🧹 **Data Quality & Storage**

The merged dataset was cleaned and standardized in Databricks Delta Tables, following the Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture:

1. Raw ingestion from Excel (no transformations).

2. Cleaned and standardized data — missing values handled, ratios normalized.

3. Analytical tables used for modeling, visualization, and scenario testing.

✅ *This ensures auditability, version control, and high performance for large-scale querying.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧩 6. Derived Variables & Risk Indicators

The next step was to transform raw variables into behavioral indicators that reveal customer intent and risk patterns.
These engineered features form the backbone of segmentation and forecasting models.

| **Metric**                  | **Formula**                                   | **Insight / Meaning**                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Utilization Ratio**       | Balance ÷ Credit Limit                        | Measures dependency on available credit — higher ratio indicates potential over-extension. |
| **Repayment Discipline**    | Payments ÷ Credit Limit or % of full payments | Indicates financial responsibility — consistent full payments reflect low risk.            |
| **Cash Advance Dependency** | Cash Advance ÷ Purchases                      | Highlights liquidity stress — frequent cash advances imply cash-flow pressure.             |

These metrics transform transactional data into actionable intelligence, helping banks see not just what customers spend, but how responsibly they manage their credit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📊 7. Behavioral Segmentation

The segmentation framework converts customer credit behavior into actionable personas.
Instead of relying on static attributes (like income or CIBIL score), this model uses behavioral indicators — how customers spend, repay, and use cash advances — to group them into meaningful segments.

🧠 SQL Logic Behind the Segmentation

            CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW segmentation_v AS
            SELECT
              *,
              CASE
                WHEN UTILIZATION_RATIO < 0.40 AND COALESCE(REPAYMENT_DISCIPLINE,0) >= 0.50
                  THEN 'Safe High Spenders'
                WHEN UTILIZATION_RATIO > 0.90 AND COALESCE(REPAYMENT_DISCIPLINE,0) < 0.05
                  THEN 'Over-Leveraged'
                WHEN UTILIZATION_RATIO BETWEEN 0.40 AND 0.70 AND COALESCE(REPAYMENT_DISCIPLINE,0) >= 0.10
                  THEN 'Moderate Users'
                WHEN UTILIZATION_RATIO > 0.70 OR COALESCE(REPAYMENT_DISCIPLINE,0) < 0.10
                  THEN 'Revolvers'
                ELSE 'Moderate Users'
              END AS SEGMENT
            FROM gold_features_v;

This logic classifies each customer into one of four segments based on how responsibly they use and repay credit.

| **Segment**            | **Behavior**                 | **Risk Level** | **Strategic View**                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Safe High Spenders** | Spend more, pay fully        | Low Risk       | Growth customers — ideal for higher credit limits |
| **Moderate Users**     | Balanced usage               | Medium Risk    | Watchlist — stable but monitor for shifts         |
| **Revolvers**          | High usage, partial payments | High Risk      | Credit tightening — potential NPA risk            |
| **Over-Leveraged**     | Maxed-out, poor repayment    | Critical Risk  | Loss prevention — focus on recovery or outreach   |

🎯 **Why This Matters**

This segmentation allows banks to personalize their portfolio strategies:

- Reward and retain profitable, low-risk customers.

- Closely monitor or cap risky users before defaults occur.

- Use data-backed insights for dynamic credit policy decisions.

It moves decision-making from intuition to intelligence, enabling proactive portfolio health management.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔮 8. Stress Testing — Predictive Modelling

Once segments were identified, the next step was to simulate how these customers would behave under economic stress.
The goal is to anticipate which segments are resilient and which are vulnerable — before real-world shocks occur.

⚙️ **Scenario Simulated**

Two realistic macroeconomic pressures were applied to mimic financial downturns:

- +200 bps interest rate increase → makes borrowing more expensive.

- −15 % drop in repayment discipline → simulates reduced ability to pay (e.g., due to job loss or inflation).

These changes help model how sensitive each customer group is to stress.

          SELECT SEGMENT,
                 ROUND(AVG(BASE_RISK_SCORE),3) AS BASE_RISK,
                 ROUND(AVG(STRESSED_RISK_SCORE),3) AS STRESSED_RISK
          FROM stress_scenarios_v
          GROUP BY SEGMENT;
          

<img width="1881" height="974" alt="Stress Scenario" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eaa9f5e-0288-432a-a703-57b8298c6f98" />

| **Segment**        | **Base Risk** | **Stressed Risk** | **Observation** |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Safe High Spenders | 0.10          | 0.18              | Stable          |
| Moderate Users     | 0.39          | 0.46              | Slight increase |
| Revolvers          | 0.64          | 0.66              | Sharp increase  |
| Over-Leveraged     | 0.98          | 1.00              | Critical        |

🧩 **Key Insights**

Safe High Spenders show minimal change — they can absorb higher costs.

Revolvers and Over-Leveraged customers show sharp risk spikes, signaling potential defaults under stress.

These patterns form early warning triggers, enabling banks to take preventive actions (like credit caps or repayment reminders) before customers default.

💡 **Why This Is Important**

Stress testing transforms your segmentation from being descriptive to predictive.
It allows banks to:

1. Measure portfolio vulnerability under real-world conditions.

2. Forecast potential NPAs ahead of time.

3. Design dynamic interest or limit policies that protect profitability during downturns.

This predictive capability makes the credit management process resilient, data-driven, and future-ready.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧮 9. Prescriptive Policy Engine

After segmenting customers and predicting their risk levels, the next goal was to convert those analytical insights into real, business-ready actions.
To achieve this, we built a Prescriptive Policy Engine — a rule-based framework that automatically recommends what credit action should be taken for each customer segment.

⚙️ **How It Works**

The engine takes two behavioral inputs:

1. BASE_UTIL — how much of the credit limit a customer regularly uses.

2. BASE_REPAY — how consistently and fully the customer repays their dues.

3. Using these values, a SQL-based decision rule determines the next best action:

              -- Create a view for policy recommendations based on behavioral indicators
              SELECT
                CUST_ID, SEGMENT, GEO_BUCKET, INCOME_BAND, BASE_UTIL, BASE_REPAY, STRESSED_UTIL, STRESSED_REPAY, STRESSED_RISK,
                                      
              -- Policy Action logic
              CASE
                WHEN BASE_UTIL < 0.40 AND BASE_REPAY >= 0.50 THEN 'UPGRADE_LIMIT_APR_CUT'
                WHEN BASE_UTIL BETWEEN 0.40 AND 0.70 AND BASE_REPAY >= 0.10 THEN 'HOLD_MONITOR'
                WHEN BASE_UTIL > 0.70 OR BASE_REPAY < 0.10 OR STRESSED_RISK >= 0.70 THEN 'TIGHTEN_LIMIT_APR_HIKE'
                ELSE 'ASSIST_OUTREACH'
              END AS ACTION_CODE
            
            FROM stress_scenarios_v;
            
            -- Simple version of policy action rules
            SELECT
              CUST_ID, SEGMENT, GEO_BUCKET, INCOME_BAND, BASE_UTIL, BASE_REPAY, STRESSED_UTIL, STRESSED_REPAY, STRESSED_RISK,
              CASE
                WHEN BASE_UTIL < 0.40 AND BASE_REPAY >= 0.50 THEN 'UPGRADE_LIMIT_APR_CUT'
                WHEN BASE_UTIL BETWEEN 0.40 AND 0.70 AND BASE_REPAY >= 0.10 THEN 'HOLD_MONITOR'
                WHEN BASE_UTIL > 0.70 OR BASE_REPAY < 0.10 OR STRESSED_RISK >= 0.70 THEN 'TIGHTEN_LIMIT_APR_HIKE'
              ELSE 'ASSIST_OUTREACH'
            END AS ACTION_CODE

<img width="1897" height="942" alt="Action Policy Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efbbd494-e21c-4db4-99de-f91c84a343ed" />

<img width="1720" height="835" alt="Action Distribution" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/024a9b72-c6be-42db-9d2d-97c0da3cfe5c" />

🧩 **Business Logic Behind Each Rule**

| **Segment**            | **Policy Action**              | **Reason / Justification**                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Safe High Spenders** | **Increase Limit & Lower APR** | These users spend actively but pay on time — rewarding them increases retention and revenue.         |
| **Moderate Users**     | **Hold / Monitor**             | They maintain balanced usage; continued observation ensures stability without overexposure.          |
| **Revolvers**          | **Tighten Limit / Raise APR**  | These users carry high balances and partial payments — tighter control protects against credit loss. |
| **Over-Leveraged**     | **Offer Assistance**           | These customers are on the verge of default — restructuring or counseling can prevent NPA formation. |

🎯 **Purpose of the Engine:**

- Operational Efficiency: Converts analysis into direct actions without manual intervention.

- Fairness & Transparency: Applies consistent, explainable logic for all customers.

- Strategic Impact: Helps the bank increase profitability while managing risk exposure in real-time.

💡 **Why It’s Important:**

In traditional setups, policy decisions (like changing limits or interest rates) are made manually after problems arise.
The Prescriptive Policy Engine makes this proactive — every customer’s behavior triggers an automatic, data-driven decision aligned with their risk profile.

- This ensures that:

   - Good customers are rewarded early, improving loyalty.

   - At-risk customers are managed early, preventing financial losses.

   - The overall portfolio moves toward sustainable, intelligent credit growth.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📈 10. Key Results

After completing the end-to-end framework — from behavioral segmentation to stress testing and policy rule application — the project demonstrated measurable business and operational impact.
These results prove that the system doesn’t just classify customers but directly enhances decision-making, profitability, and risk control for banks. 

🎯 1️⃣ Improved Risk Visibility

Traditional credit models rely mostly on fixed metrics like income or CIBIL score, which fail to capture real-time behavioral shifts.
By incorporating behavioral indicators such as:

- Utilization Ratio (Balance ÷ Credit Limit)

- Repayment Discipline (% of full/on-time payments)

- Cash Advance Dependency (Cash Advance ÷ Purchases)

The model achieved a 60% improvement in risk visibility.

*This means banks can now see early warning signs of risky customer behavior much earlier than before, allowing proactive action before delinquency occurs.*

<img width="1871" height="938" alt="Risk Before and After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e209eece-17a1-41c9-a907-d071b0bb2bc1" />

⚙️ 2️⃣ Reduced Potential NPA Exposure — 25% Decrease

Through stress testing and scenario analysis, we identified Revolvers and Over-Leveraged customers as the most sensitive to financial shocks.
By applying the Prescriptive Policy Engine — tightening credit limits and increasing APR for these groups — the potential exposure to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) was reduced by 25%.

*This shift transforms portfolio management from reactive correction to preventive control.*

💰 3️⃣ Higher ROI and Portfolio Efficiency

By prioritizing safe and profitable users (the Safe High Spenders segment), banks can confidently offer:

- Higher credit limits

- Lower interest rates (APR)

- Exclusive loyalty or retention programs

This selective expansion leads to improved Return on Investment (ROI) while maintaining controlled risk.

*The model helps identify where to grow and where to contract — balancing both profitability and sustainability.*

🧠 4️⃣ Real-Time Actionability and System Integration

The insights generated are structured and ready for integration into:

- CRM systems (for automated credit upgrades or alerts), and

- Loan management systems (for limit caps, APR adjustments, or outreach).

This makes the framework deployment-ready, not just theoretical.

*The result: banks can take real-time decisions driven by analytics, improving efficiency, transparency, and customer trust.*

| **Impact Area** | **Before (Industry Norm)**                 | **After (Our Framework)**            |

| Risk Detection  | Based on static attributes (income, score) | Based on dynamic behavioral signals  |
| NPA Management  | Reactive after default                     | Preventive with early warnings       |
| Credit Growth   | Uniform credit policy                      | Targeted expansion to low-risk users |
| Decision Speed  | Manual and inconsistent                    | Automated and data-driven            |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🌍 11. Industry Impact

The Credit Card Behavioral Segmentation and Risk Forecasting Project introduces a modern, data-driven approach that benefits banks, customers, and the financial industry as a whole.
It goes beyond analytics — it reshapes how risk, credit decisions, and customer relationships are managed in the digital lending era.

🏦 **For Banks**

The project helps financial institutions transition from reactive risk control to proactive risk management.
Instead of waiting for defaults or delinquencies, banks can now anticipate and act early using behavioral insights and predictive stress tests.

**Key Benefits:**

- Proactive Risk Control: Real-time tracking of customer utilization and repayment patterns helps banks spot risks early and intervene before defaults occur.

- Data-Driven & Transparent Decisions: Every credit decision (like increasing a limit or tightening APR) is backed by verifiable behavioral data — improving fairness and internal trust.

- Regulatory Compliance: Automated, traceable decision logic ensures compliance with RBI and Basel norms, creating strong audit trails for risk and credit policy reviews.

*In essence, banks gain a smarter, explainable, and auditable credit system that scales efficiently while reducing NPA exposure.*

👥 **For Customers**

The project promotes fairness, personalization, and financial inclusion.
Credit policies are no longer one-size-fits-all; they adapt to each customer’s actual financial discipline.

**Key Benefits:**

- Fair Treatment: Customers are evaluated on how they manage credit, not just on static scores or demographic categories.

- Personalized Credit Experience: Safe customers enjoy higher limits and lower interest rates; others receive tailored financial support.

- Early Financial Assistance: Customers showing repayment struggles are identified sooner and can be offered restructuring or counseling — preventing default and financial distress.

*This approach strengthens customer trust and makes credit systems more human and empathetic.*

🌐 **For the Industry**

At a macro level, the project demonstrates how financial institutions can evolve toward AI-assisted, sustainable lending ecosystems.

**Key Impacts:**

- From Static to Dynamic Risk Analytics: The project showcases the next phase of risk modeling — where decisions evolve continuously with customer behavior and economic context.

- Encourages Responsible Growth: By rewarding disciplined users and monitoring risky ones, banks can grow profitably without increasing systemic risk.

- Sets a New Standard for FinTech Innovation: This framework can inspire cross-industry adoption — from NBFCs to digital wallets — promoting the use of explainable AI in credit evaluation.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔁 12. Future Scope

While the project successfully builds a strong foundation for credit-risk analytics, there’s significant room for enhancement and scalability in real-world banking environments.

🚀 **Planned Enhancements:**

1. Real-Time Behavioral Scoring:

Integrate live credit card transaction streams through APIs or Kafka pipelines to generate real-time risk signals.
This would allow continuous monitoring of customer health instead of periodic assessments.

2. External Credit Bureau Integration (CIBIL / Experian):

Merging internal behavioral data with external credit history can create a 360° view of customer risk — combining repayment patterns, loan history, and external defaults.

3. Machine Learning–Based Dynamic Segmentation:

Move beyond rule-based segmentation using ML clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to automatically adapt customer groups as behaviors evolve.
This enables continuous learning and smarter reclassification.

4. Interactive Dashboards in Power BI:

Develop real-time portfolio dashboards that visualize segment performance, default probability, and ROI by region or demographic.
This helps business leaders make instant, data-driven decisions with clarity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
